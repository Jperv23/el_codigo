    <string name="bio_text_geo">Gerardo Jimenez is a Android Development Fellow at Pursuit who carries
    with him a passion for learning about the latest in technology and what it means for the quality
    of life of others in both the near and distant future. Those who know him call him Geo and he is a
    lover of black coffee, Blizzard games, comic books, and the scientific method. Geo is a proud son
    of Colombian immigrants, he shows his pride by engaging with the younger members of his family in
    Spanish, teaching them his mothers recipes, and reminding them that it is important to remember
    their family history. His hope is to be a role model to his nieces and nephews so that they might
    chase their dreams and find their own success.</string>
